#Our code requires no configurations steps. All the things used in the code are built-in.
#For executing the code, python3 should be used. The files that should go to each node is as follows:

#TCPClient.py > T1
#UDPClient.py > U1
#GatewayServer.py > Gateway
#RouterT2.py > T2
#RouterU2.py > U2
#DestinationT3.py > T3
#DestinationU3.py > U3

#As for executing our code, apart from client codes, that is TCPClient.py and UDPClient.py, running codes with python3 command is enough.

#For client scripts, as stated in the homework page, they should be run with python3 TCPClient.py U3 or for UDPClient, python3 UDPClient.py U3. The destination shoul be capitalized.
